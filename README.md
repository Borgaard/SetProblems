# Set and Hash problems

## Sets

### 1. Eisenhower Decision Matrix
Practice using sets to setup a partitioned todo list.

```sh
$ node
.load eisenhower.js
```

### 2. ACL and request validation
Practice using sets to validate security requirements of requests

```sh
$ node
.load acl.js
```

## Hashes

### 1. Write a function that takes as input a set of words and return groups of anagrams for those words. 

### 2. Write a function to test whether the letters of a word can be rearranged such that the word is palindrome.

### 3. Write a function which given two paragraphs of text determine if you can write the first using words from the latter.

### 4. Write a function which given a array of strings and a number k, return the k most frequently repeated strings

### 5. Write a function that takes an array and returns the length of the longest subarray with the property that all its elements are distinct. For example ['f',s,f,e,t,w,e,n,w,e] then the longest subarray all of whose elements are distinct is [s,f,e,t,w]
